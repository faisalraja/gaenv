Description: **gaenv** - Command line utility for managing appengine thirdparty packages
        
        Installation::
        
            $ sudo pip install gaenv
        
        Or download directly at [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gaenv)
        
        
        Example Usage::
        
            Create a requirements.txt and put all requirements then run
            $ gaenv
            For more
            $ gaenv -h
            or with python extracted source
            python gaenv -h
            
        Note that this not run "pip install -r requirements.txt" so you'll have to run it manually first before running this.
        
        
        This will create symbolic links from your default python version packages to
        the current directory that you execute it on. By default it will create
        gaenv_lib folder with all packages in your requirements.txt and will
        ask you if you want this utility to insert the import statement that updates
        your sys.path, or you can just do it manually.
